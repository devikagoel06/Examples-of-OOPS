Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.It acts as a protective shield which prevents data to be accessed from being accessed by code outside this shield.
We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.

Advantages of Encapsulation in Java are:
1)It provides you the control over the data.
2)It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
3)The encapsulate class is easy to test. 

Disadvantages of Encapsulation in Java are:
1)If proper encapsulation is not followed in a code,it can lead to bad designing.
